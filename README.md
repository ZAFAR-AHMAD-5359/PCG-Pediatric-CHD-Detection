Implementation of the paper ["Automatic detection of paediatric congenital heart diseases from phonocardiogram signals"](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=D5W9TVwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=D5W9TVwAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C).

## Abstract

This repository contains the official implementation of our algorithm for automatic detection of congenital heart diseases (CHD) in pediatric patients using phonocardiogram signals. Our approach leverages advanced signal processing and machine learning techniques to identify patterns indicative of various congenital heart conditions.

## Features

- Automated analysis of pediatric phonocardiogram recordings
- Detection algorithms for multiple congenital heart disease types
- Preprocessing pipeline optimized for pediatric heart sounds
- Performance evaluation metrics and visualization tools
- Comparative analysis with existing methods
